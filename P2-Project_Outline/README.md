## Submission Instructions

### Overview
This product is a website intended to aid in the creating and organizing tables of encoded units (narremes) from language samples. 
A human is necessary at this stage to break down samples into natomic data, and this website provides the space to work, store, and organize large volumes of samples many times faster than the current available methods.
The User Story is of someone who arrives at the home page to either register/login and begin working, or of a user who wishes to explore the available data reports from a searchable database.
This project is a tool that will aid something I am passionate about and is more complicated than I currently know how to do, but its value to me is a driving force in my efforts to make it.
